An example forking workflow
In this workshop you will work from a central repo owned by Earth Lab. You will:

1.     Fork this repo owned by Earth Lab into your GitHub account.

2.     Clone the fork of your repo, so you can edit the contents locally

3.     Make edits to your local cloned copy of the repo on your computer

4.     add, commit and push those edits back to your fork on GitHub

5.     Suggest the changes that you made, to be added to the Earth Lab central repo using a pull request
